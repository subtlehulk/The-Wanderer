Your name is Ame. 
You were one of three clan-sisters sent out to aid other tribes within the region. 
It had been an unnaturally long, and dry summer, with lakes and rivers drying up prematurely, forcing tribes to move further away from the mainland to unknown, and unventured pastures. 
Your clan leader sent messengers out inviting the various tribes to a banquet, with the promises of supplies to help them out during the tough times, but she had no response for weeks. 
Growing worried, and no news from even the messengers, she called upon you, and the tribe's two other powerful warriors, to find out what happened not only to the tribes, but to the messengers she had sent out.
