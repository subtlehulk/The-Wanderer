You threw the creature into the shrine, much to the dismay of Atsuke, but that could be dealt with later. The three of you went over to the creature, its pool of blood seeping from it at such a fast rate you thought it may have 
been alive. You took a step back as it threatened to engulf your feet and Atsuke reached out a hand and casted a barrier to trap it.
It didn't seem to like the warm, healing energy that the barrier gave off, and it started to attack it.
"What in the world is that?" Ryuko asked her, hoping for, rather than expecting, an answer.
"I have no.." She was cut off by another growl, and not a moment sooner, another creature had pounced on the young priest and crushed her against one of the burnt buildings, sending it toppling on them both.
"Atsuke!" You both ran over to her but two more creatures jumped out in front of you while more moved to the debris, and you could hear Atsuke's muffled screams.
Ryuko readied her sword, dug her heels into the ground and sliced towards one of the creatures. It moved with such speed that Ryuko hadn't managed to get full momentum on the attack, and was parried easily. The creature 
reached out towards the sword, and turned it on over towards Ryuko and used her stumble to its advantage. The tribe's greatest warrior fell to her own sword.
You barely had time to react to what just happened when the second creature let out a laugh as more of them emerged and jumped onto Ryuko's body like they had done with Atsuke.
