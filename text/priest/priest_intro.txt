Your name is Atsuke. 
You were one of three powerful clan-sisters your tribe, and the region, has ever known. Blessed with the power to wield Light magic strong enough to heal a broken world, you are the tribe's Healer, and the clan leader's aid.
Your clan leader had received devastating news from two tribes of a fire that broke out during an anointing ceremony to celebrate the clan's newest priests. 
Not wanting to send his greatest priest, your clan leader sent a couple of your acolytesto help aid the fallen but as time went on, there had been no word of their success, or even arrival. 
Growing worried, he asked one of your clan sisters, Michiko, to go and find out what was wrong - as strong as she is, Michiko is extremely superstitious and would not accept the mission without her sisters, 
and so persuaded your clan leader to send you, and your other sister Ame, along with her.
