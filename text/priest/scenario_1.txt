"Why did you really ask for us to come along, Ryuko?" you asked your Sister, kicking a stone into the river you stopped at for a break. "I know you don't like doing things without us, 
but you could have taken Dren, he's top of his class back at the temple."
Ryuko smiled.
  "When was the last time the three of us went on an adventure? All we do is wait for the tournament to come around, and escort other tribes to the forest line."
You nodded in agreement.
  "That sounds about right. But you know she doesn't like sending us unless she has to."
Ryuko held up a hand to cut you off.
  "Just enjoy the country side, and be ready to do some healing once we've reached the settlement, okay? Yoko, let's go. Put the birds down."
Yoko, your druid Sister let out an audible sound of defiance before releasing the two birds that had greeted her when you first settled at the river bed.
You picked up your bags, blessed your Sisters with Light, and you carried down along the riverside.
  'Not long to go now, anyway.' you told yourself.

***

The river had ran for miles before there was a suitable crossing. Ryuko ensured it was safe first, and upon closer inspection, gestured for everyone to cross. 
Once over, things did not appear to be safe.
As you turned to look back at the bridge, you heard Ryuko shout.
  "Defend yourselves!" 
Your head snapped back around in time to see a shadowy figure descend upon Ryuko, who met the creature with her infamous parry, and blocked the attack, however, she looked extremely 
strained from the single move.
Yoko growled and transformed into her Bear form, her pale skin replaced by the darkest fur with silver, shimmering runes glowing around her.
As your sister attacked the creature, you heard movement to your right, and another shadowy figure emerged and attacked you on sight.
