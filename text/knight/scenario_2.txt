As you retrieved your sword from the dead creature, you gazed upon its black and purple disfigured body with disgust. What you assumed was blood looked as though it was trying to run away from the corpse of the body it once 
brought life to, but you were snapped out of that trail of thought as you heard your sisters struggling with even more of those things.
Yoko chopped down one of them, but recoiled when an unexpecting spray of its purple blood sprayed at her, another creature profited on the opportunity.
"Yoko, look out!" You shouted at her. She dodged just in time, and used her bear strength to swipe at the creature and sweep its head clean off - or what one could assume was its head.
Once more, the unexpected spray clouded her and she began coughing. You ran to her, only to see four more of them swoop down and devour her, her screams echoing around the forest.
"No! Yoko!" You swung your sword as hard as you could but it did not manage to slice through the creature, nor did it turn to look at you. It just grunted and continue on to cover Yoko and doing whatever it was doing to her.
"Atsuke!" You look around for your other Clan-Sister but it was too late, you met her lifeless gaze not far from Yoko. Her eyes had already glossed over, and it looked as though she had aged a hundred years.
Anger, shock, hatred, helplessness built up inside of you and you raised your sword high over your head once more, and this time the creatures took notice and focused their attention on you.
