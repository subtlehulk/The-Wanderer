Your name is Michiko. 
You were one of the three clan-sisters of the Rein tribe. 
You were sent out, along with your Sisters, to check on the other, smaller tribes of the region. 
It had been a harsh Winter, and your clan leader had heard no response from the others on whether or not the traditional 10-year tournament was still going ahead as planned. 
As the days, and nights, continued to roll by, he became worried that the Winter may have been too much for them, and he decided it would be best to send his three best warriors to aid their brothers and sisters.
