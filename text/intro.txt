Welcome to The Wanderer!
A text-based adventure game where you take control of a character of your choosing!
You will have three classes to choose from:
1. Knight - a sturdy warrior, with high defence, and equally as strong melee attacks.
2. Druid - almost the opposite of the Knight, a druid will call upon nature to boost their defence, and bolster their already strong attacks.
3. Priest - the healing class, Priests rely on their magic abilities to overcome opposition, with mana and potions to help them do so.

You will venture through the land of Terah, following the story of one of three Clan-Sisters, who each have their own journey to partake in.
