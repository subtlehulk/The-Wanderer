The wind blows against your bare face, the ice cold rain batters your soaked robes, threatening to drown you before you reach the next village.
'Why didn't I bring spare robes?' you ask yourself.
You hear branches snap to the side of you, and your attention immediately focuses on a figure that appeared out of nowhere.
  'Fancy seeing you here, boy.' came a familiar voice. 
You recognise the emphasise on the word 'boy'.
  'Why are you here, master?' you respond, drawing on your energy slowly. He will surely sense it, otherwise.
  'You know exactly why I am here. It's time for you to perish...for good.'
